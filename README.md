ðŸ“ŠCensus-Analysis


Overview
This project involves exploring and analyzing census data to uncover demographic and economic trends. The analysis was performed using SQL for data extraction and Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and summary reporting.

It demonstrates skills in:

Data cleaning & transformation (Excel)

SQL querying & optimization (joins, filtering, aggregations)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive actionable insights



What I Did
Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicates and handled missing values in Excel.

Applied data validation to ensure integrity of demographic and income fields.

SQL Analysis:

Wrote optimized SQL queries to join datasets and extract insights on population distribution, income groups, and regional statistics.

Used grouping and aggregation to summarize key metrics.

Insights:

Identified trends in age groups, income distribution, and regional disparities.

Created summaries that can aid in policy decisions or targeted studies.
